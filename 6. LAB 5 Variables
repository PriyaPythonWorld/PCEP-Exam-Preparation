Here is a short story:
Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had
six apples. They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.
Your task is to:
create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit
possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, and separate
each of them with a comma;
now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three
previous variables;
print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and
perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g. +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a
string and an integer together on one line, e.g. "Total number of
apples:" and total_apples.

john = 3
mary = 5
adam = 6
print(john, mary, adam, sep=",")

total_apples = john+mary+adam
print(total_apples)

# chat gpt
# Assign values to variables
john = 3
mary = 5
adam = 6

# Print the values of the variables separated by commas
print(john, mary, adam)

# Calculate the total number of apples and store it in total_apples
total_apples = john + mary + adam

# Print the total number of apples
print("Total number of apples:", total_apples)

# Experimenting with other operations
new_apples = total_apples * 2  # Doubling the total number of apples
print("Doubled apples:", new_apples)

apples_divided = total_apples / 3  # Dividing the apples among 3 people
print("Each gets:", apples_divided)

# Further experiments with arithmetic operations
subtract_apples = total_apples - 4  # Subtracting 4 apples
print("After losing 4 apples:", subtract_apples)

multiply_apples = john * mary  # Multiplying John's and Mary's apples
print("Multiplication of John's and Mary's apples:", multiply_apples)
