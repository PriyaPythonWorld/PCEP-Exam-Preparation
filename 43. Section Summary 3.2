# Question 1: Create a for loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the following skeleton:
for i in range(1, 11):
    if i % 2 != 0:
        print(i)
print()

# Question 2: Create a while loop that counts from 0 to 10, and prints odd numbers to the screen. Use the following skeleton:
x = 1
print(x)
while x < 11:
    if x % 2 != 0:
        x += 2
        print(x)
print()

'''
Question 3: Create a program with a for loop and a break statement. The program should
iterate over characters in an email address, exit the loop when it reaches the @ symbol, and
print the part before @ on one line. Use the following skeleton:
'''
for ch in "john.smith@pythoninstitute.org":
    if ch == "@":
        break
    print(ch, end="")
print()
print()

'''
# Question 4: Create a program with a for loop and a continue statement. The program
# should iterate over a string of digits, replace each 0 with x, and print the modified string to the
# screen. Use the following skeleton:
# '''
new_digit = ""
for digit in "0165031806510":
    if digit == "0":
        new_digit += "x"
        continue
        # digit = digit.replace("0", "x")
    new_digit += digit
print(new_digit)
print()

# Question 5: What is the output of the following code?
n = 3
while n > 0:
    print(n + 1)
    n -= 1
else:
    print(n)
print()

# Question 6: What is the output of the following code?
n = range(4)
for num in n:
    print(num-1)
else:
    print(num)
print()

# Question 7: What is the output of the following code?
for i in range(0, 6, 3):
    print(i)
