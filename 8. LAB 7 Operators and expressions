LAB 7 Operators and expressions
Take a look at the following code: it reads a float value, puts it into a variable named x, and
prints the value of a variable named y. Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate
the following expression:
3x3 – 2x2 + 3x – 1
The result should be assigned to y.
Remember that classical algebraic notation likes to omit the multiplication operator ‒ you need
to use it explicitly. Note how we change data type to make sure that x is of type float.
Keep your code clean and readable, and test it using the data we've provided, each time
assigning it to the x variable (by hardcoding it). Don't be discouraged by any initial failures. Be
persistent and inquisitive.
Sample input
x = 0
x = 1
x = -1
Sample output
y = -1.0
y = 3.0
y = -9.0
Code
Sample Solution
x = # Hardcode your test data here.
x = float(x)
# Write your code here.
print("y =", y)

'''
x = -1


a = (3 * (x ** 3))
b = (2 * (x ** 2))
c = (3 * x)
d = 1
y = a - b + c - d
print(float(y))

# ---------------------------------------------------

# chat gpt

x = 1  # Hardcoded value; can be changed to test other inputs like 0, -1
x = float(x)

# Correct expression as per the task: 3x^3 - 2x^2 + 3x - 1
y = (3 * x ** 3) - (2 * x ** 2) + (3 * x) - 1

# Print the value of y
print("y =", y)
