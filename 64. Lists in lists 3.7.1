# Assuming WHITE_PAWN is a defined variable, otherwise define it like this:
WHITE_PAWN = "P"  # Example definition of WHITE_PAWN

# Creating a row with 8 WHITE_PAWN elements using a for loop
row = []
for i in range(8):
    row.append(WHITE_PAWN)
print(row)

# Creating the same row using list comprehension
row = [WHITE_PAWN for i in range(8)]
print(row)

# List of squares of numbers from 0 to 9
squares = [x ** 2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

# Powers of 2 from 2^0 to 2^7
twos = [2 ** i for i in range(8)]
print(twos)

# Odd numbers from the list of squares
odds = [x for x in squares if x % 2 != 0]
print(odds)
