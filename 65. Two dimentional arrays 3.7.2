# Assuming ROOK, KNIGHT, PAWN, and EMPTY are defined, otherwise define them like this:
ROOK = "R"      # Example definition of ROOK
KNIGHT = "N"    # Example definition of KNIGHT
PAWN = "P"      # Example definition of PAWN
EMPTY = "."     # Example definition of an empty square

    row = [EMPTY for i in range(8)]  # Create a row of 8 EMPTY squares
    board.append(row)  # Add row to the board

# Alternatively, creating the 8x8 board using list comprehension
board = [[EMPTY for i in range(8)] for j in range(8)]

# Placing pieces on the board
board[0][0] = ROOK     # Top-left corner
board[0][7] = ROOK     # Top-right corner
board[7][0] = ROOK     # Bottom-left corner
board[7][7] = ROOK     # Bottom-right corner
board[4][2] = KNIGHT   # Placing a KNIGHT at (4, 2)
board[3][4] = PAWN     # Placing a PAWN at (3, 4)

# Print the board for visualization
for row in board:
